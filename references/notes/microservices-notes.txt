Introduction to Microservices
	- Architecture Styles
	- Monolith
	- Distributed Architecture
	- SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
	- MSA (Microservices based Architecture)
	- Principles of Microserives
	- Characteristics of Microservices
		- Componentiation as Services
		- Organized around Business Capabilities
		- Design for Failure
		- Infrastructure Automation -> DevOps -> Maven, Jenkins, Docker, K8s
		- Decentralized Data Management
		- Decentralized Governance => AuthZ (specific to service) => AuthN (Token based OAuth)
		- Products not Projects 
		- Smart Endpoints Dumb Pipes
		- Evolutionary Design
	- Microservices and API Ecosystem
	- Benefits and Limitations

Microservices Architecture
	- REST API
	- Messaging
	- Inter Service Communication
	- Transaction Management
	- Reference Architecture
	
Microservices Design
	- DDD (Domain Driven Design)
		- Domain
		- Domain Logic/Business Logic
		- Model
		- Context
		- Bounded Context
		- Entity 
		- ValueObject
		- Aggregate
		- Repository		
		- Factory
	
	- Design Patterns
		- Decomposing Microserives
				- Cohesion -> SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) -> Do exactly one task. Do it better.
				- Loose Coupling -> CCP (Common Closure Principle) -> Keep all related things together
			- Decompose by business capability
				- decompose app based on business functionality / org structure
				- follows Conway's Laws => system design (Arch) tend to be similar to org structure
				
				Pitfalls:
				---
					- Inefficiences in the existing org structure / process could be carried in the service design
				
			- Decompose by business sub-domain (DDD - Domain Driven Design)
				 
				 - decompose app based on business sub-domain
						- banking
							- account mgmt (bounded context) (core)
								- account (core)
								- customer (support) -> details captured with respect to a/c
															
							- customer mgmt (support)
								- customer (core) -> details captured with respect to customer
								
							- support (generic)
								- ticket (core)
								- customer (support)
								- notification (generic)
				- helps to figure out if any inefficiency in the existing process / org structure
			
		- Cross Cutting Concerns	-> Microservices Chasis -> Spring Boot and Cloud
		- Service Discovery
			- Registry Server
				- Eureka (Spring Cloud Netflix) => spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server
				- Consul (Hashicorp)
				- Zookeeper
				
			- Service Registration
				- product-service	=> spring-cloud-starter-eureka-client
				- spring.application.name = product-service
				- eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true

			- Service Discovery
				- discovery-service	=> spring-cloud-starter-eureka-client
				- eureka.client.fetch-registry=true
				- Lookup using service-id => product-service
				
		- Configuration Management
			- Spring Cloud Config
			
			- Configuration Server => spring-cloud-config-server
			- Configuration Client => spring-cloud-starter-config
			
			- Spring Cloud Bus => [stardard events] helps to propagate the events from one source service to one or many target services
				- Spring Cloud Bus Config Server	[Source]
				- Spring Cloud Bus Config Client	[Target 1..n]
			
			- Spring Cloud Stream => [custom events/msgs] helps to stream messages from one source to one or more target services
				- RabbitMQ
				- Kafka
				
		- Data Management
		- Service Deployment
		- Observability
		- Communication Styles
		- Security
		- UI Patterns
		- External API
			- API Gateway
			- Backend for Frontend
		- Transactional Messaging
		- Reliablity
		- Testing
		
Microservices Development

		- Distributed Configuration Management
			- spring-cloud-config-server
			- spring-cloud-config-client
		
		- Service Registry and Discovery
			- Eureka Server
			- Eureka Client -> Registration
			- Eureka Client -> Discovery
			
			- spring-cloud-service-registry
			- spring-cloud-service-registration
			- spring-cloud-service-discovery
		- API Gateway

		- Circuit Breaker
			- Hystrix
			- spring-cloud-hystrix
			- Circuit Breaker Properties
				- circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold -> 3

				- metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds -> 10secs
				- circuitBreaker.sleepWindowInMilliseconds -> 10secs
